# Roadmap 2022

This is the roadmap planned by the Integration team at Meilisearch for the year 2022.

Nothing is definitive: the roadmap can be adapted depending on the need of the users and the company.

## 2022: the Main Lines

#### Objectives

- Better know our users and our community to ease our decision making
  - set the analytics on every integration
  - Extract information from them to prioritize our tasks
- Keep working with the community, improve our way of working with the contributors by creating clearer issues, and by providing more and more "good first issues".
- Work with the @meilisearch/devrel-team to have help for the support for answering issues. The goal is to allow the integration team developers to focus on the PR reviews and their coding tasks, rather than doing support.
- Work with the @meilisearch/docs-team to provide complete and easy-to-maintain documentation for each SDK
- Be more organized regarding our rhythm of working
    - during the pre-release period: improve the process and define steps for each sprint
    - during the implementation period: find the right balance between maintainance and new content addition.
- Road to v1! In 2022, Meilisearch is starting the implementation and the stabilization of the API regarding the release of the first stable version of Meilisearch (v1.0.0). The integration team must start to think about it and adapt their integrations in this v1 objective. For example, the stabilization of the most popular integrations will be necessary.
- Release our first database integrations since we don't provide any in 2021.

#### Human resources

## Q2

Analytics:
- [ ] Finish the implementation in the remaining SDKs:
  - [ ] _(delayed to Q3 because it will be possible to implement only after v0.28)_ Javascript
  - [ ] _(delayed to Q3 because the idea is not to add more code to the Java SDK before the refactor)_ Java
  - [x] Rust
- [x] Plan how we will implement the analytics on the non-sdk.
- [x] Define the specs to support analytics in front-end tools with core team.
- [ ] _(delayed to Q3 because it will be possible to implement only after v0.28)_ Implement it on the all the integrations maintained by the integration team.

Processes:
- [x] Change the Integrations' Team developers scope: make it adapted to each developer, but also to reduce the context switches.

Improvements:
- [ ] _(ongoing work, will be ready on Q3)_ Add a helpful docker/compose setup in every integration.
- [ ] _(postponed, no return forecast)_ Code coverage:
  - [ ] Define the tool which will be used (codecov, coveralls, others).
  - [ ] Implement it in the SDKs.
  - [ ] Implement it on the integrations which makes sense to have coverage.

Meilisearch releases:
- [x] [v0.27 work](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/issues/190):
  - [x] Docker run changes
  - [x] Support nested fields
  - [x] Customize the typo tolerance
  - [x] Add support to use the new cropping and highlighting search attributes
- [ ] _(ongoing work, will be ready on Q3)_ [v0.28 work](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/issues/205):
  - [ ] New API namings, could impact multiple resources and nomenclatures, like dumps, keys, search, and indexes.
  - [ ] New behavior to update keys
  - [ ] HTTP verbs changes
  - [ ] Add pagination to the multiple API resources (keys, tasks, indexes, documents).
  - [ ] Changes related to the dumps resources
  - [ ] Add PATCH support to Java SDK.

## Q3

The general idea for the 3rd quarter is:

- Have all of our integrations (but DevOps tools) with the analytics implementation, to give us data to improve our decision-making in the future.
- Finish ongoing projects like documentation and docker.
- Ruby community is the 3rd most used according to our internal metrics, and we have some features asked by the users that could be implemented with a small-time effort. The same idea can be applied to the Symfony integration, not necessarily with new features, but maintenance in general.
- Java is a whole subject apart since it has a huge maintainability problem because it has a double implementation and has a lack of support for the PATCH method.

With that thought in mind, we should be able to start planning new integrations in the next quarters since we will have dealt with most of the critical issues/finished some working-in-progress jobs in this quarter.
